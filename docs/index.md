# Introduction 

Welcome to the Spinning Up documentation!

During building the machine learning tools, we find that some users, especially the beginner, need to a simple but clear introduction. Inspired by the good example of [OpenAI Spinning Up in deep RL](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/), this is an educational resource that makes it easier to get started in important application areas.
